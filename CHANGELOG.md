# dbt_greenhouse_source v0.4.1
## Under the Hood
- Leveraged the `{{ dbt_utils.type_timestamp() }}` macro within the staging models for all timestamp fields. 
  - This is needed as certain Redshift warehouses sync these fields as `timestamptz` by default which causes compilation errors in downstream models. This macro safely removes timezone values from the UTC timestamps and ensures success in downstream transformations.
# dbt_greenhouse_source v0.4.0
ðŸŽ‰ dbt v1.0.0 Compatibility ðŸŽ‰
## ðŸš¨ Breaking Changes ðŸš¨
- Adjusts the `require-dbt-version` to now be within the range [">=1.0.0", "<2.0.0"]. Additionally, the package has been updated for dbt v1.0.0 compatibility. If you are using a dbt version <1.0.0, you will need to upgrade in order to leverage the latest version of the package.
  - For help upgrading your package, I recommend reviewing this GitHub repo's Release Notes on what changes have been implemented since your last upgrade.
  - For help upgrading your dbt project to dbt v1.0.0, I recommend reviewing dbt-labs [upgrading to 1.0.0 docs](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/guides/migration-guide/upgrading-to-1-0-0) for more details on what changes must be made.
- Upgrades the package dependency to refer to the latest `dbt_fivetran_utils`. The latest `dbt_fivetran_utils` package also has a dependency on `dbt_utils` [">=0.8.0", "<0.9.0"].
  - Please note, if you are installing a version of `dbt_utils` in your `packages.yml` that is not in the range above then you will encounter a package dependency error.

# dbt_greenhouse_source v0.3.1

## Bug Fixes
- Addition of the `meta` config within the relevant `src_greenhouse.yml` tables that are able to be disabled by the user. These configs allow the source freshness tests to skip over the disabled models. ([#15](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_greenhouse_source/pull/15))

# dbt_greenhouse_source v0.1.0 -> v0.3.0
